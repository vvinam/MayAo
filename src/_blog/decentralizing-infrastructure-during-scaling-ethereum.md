An endeavour to collaborate on creating a powerful foundation for the future of the Ethereum community, [Scaling Ethereum](https://scaling.ethglobal.co/), has come to a close, resulting in some innovative and inspiring solutions. The IPFS and Filecoin projects, alongside the ETHGlobal team, sponsored this 4-week hackathon event.
