## **How to Store and Maintain NFT Metadata**

![](../assets/release-notes-placeholder-2b442ee5.png)

What is NFT metadata, what are the risks affecting it, and how does IPFS help NFT holders secure their digital assets for the long term? Non-fungible tokens are among the most exciting recent developments in the cryptoverse. NFTs are like digital collectibles, each unique in its own way and linked to a particular user. Ownership aside, what also makes an NFT valuable is its metadata.

## Around the ecosystem üåè

Nearly one year ago, the Filecoin mainnet launched! From October 18 - 22, the Filecoin, IPFS, and Protocol Labs ecosystems are coming together to celebrate with **Filecoin Orbit**. Check out the event and [register to join in](http://orbit.filecoin.io/) for a week of talks, demos, workshops, and more.

Decentralized cloud drive [IPFS Drive](https://www.ipfsdrive.com/) is now live: a storage application used for file management, data encryption, and cloud drive mounting on the IPFS network. It has the characteristics of high-speed transmission and high security, and can obtain long-term free storage space from storage providers with support for [Filswan](https://filswan.com/#/dashboard) and [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage/).

Couldn‚Äôt make it to Prague for the Nonfungible Castle event? Well you can watch all of the action in the [livestream](https://www.nfcastle.com/streaming) starting on October 16th.

The new release of [CID Gravity](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/CEHTVSEG6/p1633430657466700), version 1.0.9, is now live and features an integration with [Bidbot from Textile](https://github.com/textileio/bidbot), a Filecoin network sidecar for storage providers to bid in storage deal auctions. CID Gravity enables storage providers to enter the storage-market and aims to allow any size of deals on the network.
