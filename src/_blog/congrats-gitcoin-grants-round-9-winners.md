Gitcoin is [a popular platform](https://gitcoin.co/) for developers to collaborate and monetize their skills ($25 million+ so far) while working on Open Source projects through bounties and hackathons. Protocol Labs recently co-sponsored their [Gitcoin Grants Round 9 Virtual Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr9/onboard).

Gitcoin grant rounds are crowdsourcing experiments where open source projects can benefit from QF (Quadratic Funding) in which community contributions are matched using a quadratic formula by Gitcoin grant round sponsors. During Round 8 they added a Hackathon component and it was so successful, that this past March, they did it again, offering \~$500k in pooled prizes.

## Our challenges, the best of IPFS and Filecoin üèÜ

For the **Gitcoin GR9 Hackathon**, Protocol Labs matched 100% of our ecosystem partners‚Äô [Textile](https://blog.textile.io/funding-the-community/) and [Fleek‚Äôs](https://blog.fleek.co/posts/gitcoin-gr9-hackathon-fleek-winners) bounties.

Our goal is to amplify the ability of our ecosystem partners to be stewards of the IPFS/Filecoin ecosystem and decentralize growth and development. Moreover $23k in bounties for Filecoin and IPFS were offered for a total of $63k in prizes available for this sub-ecosystem in GR9. We wanted to see the best of the best for tools, libraries, APIs, apps, integrations, and more.

Out of 167 projects total, with 36 submissions to our ecosystem bounties, here are the prize winners:
