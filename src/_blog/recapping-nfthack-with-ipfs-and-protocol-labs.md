In March, Protocol Labs sponsored [NFTHack](https://nfthack.ethglobal.co/), a weekend long hackathon and summit to gather creatives and engineers focused on NFTs. The event sparked a multitude of conversations and ideas surrounding creative and sustainable solutions to NFT storage.

For example, [nft.storage](http://nft.storage/) is a new service built specifically for storing off-chain NFT data on IPFS and Filecoin. Nft.Storage was a tremendous asset during the NFTHack weekend. The service made it possible for participants to focus fully on their hacks knowing that their off-chain data was safely being stored by nft.storage on IPFS and Filecoin. During the event alone, 1204 NFTs were stored on IPFS.

Between March 15-21 over 2,000 people visited nft.storage and a quarter of all NFTHack builders used it. Overall, 10% of all of the event participants used the JavaScript library powering nft.storage to store their NFTs.

The $5k bounty for the event prize was split into two $1.5k awards and one $2k award.

* The winner of ‚ÄúThe ü§Ø Prize‚Äù was NFT (The üö´Not Not-a-üî• Flamethrower Token). Yes, it‚Äôs a flamethrower; but a flamethrower that creates an NFT out of anything it burns.
* One runner up was [GFT](https://showcase.ethglobal.co/nfthack/gft-pronounced-gift), which connects creators and consumers through NFTS.
* The other runner up was Rodeo, which lets people quickly spin up NFT galleries for their websites.
