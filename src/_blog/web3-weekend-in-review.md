What better way to dive into all things Web3 than a weekend hackathon? The folks at ETHGlobal thought so, and we joined them during the last weekend in May for [Web3 Weekend](https://web3.ethglobal.co/).

This three-day event kicked off with a full-day summit, bringing together experts and illuminaries from across the ecosystem to encourage and inspire builders to challenge the idea of whatâ€™s possible with decentralized technologies. At the end of the day, IPFS and Filecoin creator Juan Benet gave a keynote on the benefits of working on Web3 now.

## Challenges + finalists

We offered a combined $20,000 Filecoin (FIL) prize pool distributed evenly between all submissions built on or with IPFS or Filecoin during Web3 Weekend. Any project built with ecosystem tools like Textile, Pinata, Fleek, Ceramic, Fission, Livepeer, and more received a prizeâ€”**over 65 finalists in total!**

Here are some of the projects that inspired us:

### Opsci Data Wallet

### The Convo Space
