## Fixing Broken NFTs with IPFS and Filecoin

![](../assets/e8a23c54-7515-4d77-806b-66843e43f3f7.png)

NFTs have hit the mainstream but unfortunately, this space is full of misconceptions, and many developers - intentionally or not - are cutting corners as they rush to capitalize on this nascent market. Though customers buy NFTs believing them to be permanent and immutable records of ownership, this is not always the case - fundamental flaws in the construction of many tokens jeopardize the long-term integrity of the asset. This is a major problem for the entire ecosystem, with the potential to rapidly erode customer faith - not just in NFTs, but in blockchain technology at large. To avoid reputational loss, the developer community needs to proactively acknowledge and address these issues. Read [**this Hackernoon post**](https://hackernoon.com/fixing-broken-nfts-with-ipfs-and-filecoin-jk1r35ab) to learn all there is to know about fixing your broken NFTs with IPFS and Filecoin.
