**Skiff Integrates IPFS to Bring Decentralization and Encryption to Consumers**

[Skiff](https://www.skiff.org/) has announced its integration of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) to add a secure, persistent, and decentralized storage layer to its collaboration product. Skiff is a private, decentralized, and end-to-end encrypted workspace for the modern web. The result of the IPFS integration will be a collaboration management application in which users can store files, images, content, PDFs, and more all through IPFS.
