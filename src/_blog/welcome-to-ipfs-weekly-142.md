Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in the [**InterPlanetary File System**](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy!

## go-ipfs v0.9.0 has been released!

![](../assets/ipfs-blog-release-0-9-0.jpg)

We're happy to announce go-ipfs 0.9.0. This release makes go-ipfs even more configurable with some fun experiments to boot. We're also deprecating or removing some uncommonly used features to make it easier for users to discover the easy ways to use go-ipfs safely and efficiently.

As usual, this release includes important fixes, some of which may be critical for security. Unless the fix addresses a bug being exploited in the wild, the fix will not be called out in the release notes. Please make sure to update ASAP. See our [**release process**](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/tree/master/docs/releases.md#security-fix-policy) for details and the [**blog post**](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/tree/master/docs/releases.md#security-fix-policy) for the release highlights, migrations, changelog, and all contributors.

## Introducing the Browsers 3000 Hackathon

IPFS, Filecoin, and our many ecosystem friends are very excited to announce the Browsers 3000 Hackathon, beginning July 8 and running through September 21, 2021!

This hackathon is a six week virtual event to explore and accelerate the development of web3 in the browser through experimentation and challenge prizes. It kicks off with a one day summit with speakers from your favorite browser makers and other projects building browser infrastructure for web3 and P2P technologies today, and will include workshops and presentations up until the show-and-tell demo and awards ceremony in September.[**Visit the Browsers 3000 website to learn more and sign up to be notified when registration opens!**](https://events.protocol.ai/2021/browsers3000)
