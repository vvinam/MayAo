Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in the [**InterPlanetary File System**](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy!

## Decentralizing the Internet's Root

![](../assets/hns.jpg)

Domain names are things most users don‚Äôt think about much, but they are part of the directions to finding any content on the web, and they‚Äôre controlled by a centralized resolution system. In a decentralized internet, however, controlling the top of the domain hierarchy would no longer be in the hands of a centralized entity. Top-level domain names would be peer-based and would no longer exist under a single point-of-failure. Find out how [**Namebase offers new solutions to resolving hostnames in the web3 future with its Handshake project**](https://blog.ipfs.io/decentralizing-the-internet-s-root/).

## Brand new on IPFS

* IPFS and Filecoin are a match made in blockchain heaven. [**Learn more **](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/using-filecoin-with-ipfs/)about the relationship between the two.
* The Mercury Hackathon kicked off yesterday but there is still time to [**register to build**](https://mercuryhackathon2021.com/?utm_source=AHTW&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=launch-poster) with IPFS, Filecoin, and Flow.
* There is now a [**fully searchable decentralized library**](https://libgen.fun/dweb.html) hosted on IPFS, which is truly a ‚Äúbreakthrough in the field‚Äù!
* Applications for the [**Filecoin Techstars Accelerator**](https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/filecoin) are officially open! [**Apply now**](https://www.f6s.com/filecoin-accelerator-2022/apply) for this new accelerator that focuses on startups building in the IPFS and Filecoin ecosystems.

## Around the ecosystem üåè

In support of the [**Crypto Climate Accord**](https://cryptoclimate.org/) (CCA), Protocol Labs and [**Energy Web**](https://www.energyweb.org/)completed the first showcase of an [**open-source solution to decarbonize Filecoin**](https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/protocol-labs-and-energy-web-complete-first-showcase-of-an-open-source-solution-to-decarbonize-1a8c22ac02f5)!  
  
The [**Browsers3000**](https://events.protocol.ai/2021/browsers3000/) hackathon is complete! Thanks to all who joined and built your visions ‚Äî stay tuned for a full event recap and a feature on the winning projects.   
  
Remember that the Filecoin Launchpad Accelerator Demo Day is right around the corner! Eleven teams from 20 countries are presenting their projects after weeks of work with [**Tachyon**](https://mesh.xyz/tachyon/) and other leaders in the Filecoin and web3 communities. [**Register to attend**](https://share.hsforms.com/1sOOp2P0hRJuuzhLG-BS4RQ3orpu).  
  
Protocol Labs, Filecoin Foundation, Ethereum Foundation and Electric Coin Co. are collaborating to unlock recursion in Halo 2 and explore the future of proofs. [**Read more about the collaboration**](https://electriccoin.co/blog/ethereum-zcash-filecoin-collab/).

## Want to help build the new internet?

[**Fullstack Developer**](https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/akasha-foundation-fullstack-developer): By combining blockchain technologies such as Ethereum and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), AKASHA has the potential to change the way ideas, thoughts, and experiences are shared and stored on the Internet. As part of the remote team distributed across the globe, you will work with some of the brightest minds in the blockchain tech space on unique and challenging ideas. You will also be in direct contact with the development and user community at large, actively participating in open discussions and brainstorming sessions. **AKASHA Foundation**, Remote.

[**ARG Software Engineer**](https://arg.protocol.ai/job-software-engineer): The Protocol Labs [**Application Research Group (ARG)**](https://arg.protocol.ai/)is seeking a proactive and autonomous builder that can draft a roadmap forward and execute with code. You will need to have both a passion for hands-on development of distributed systems as well as problem solving within a complex system. **Protocol Labs**, Remote.

[**Developer Relations**](https://boards.greenhouse.io/textileio/jobs/4075619004): Textile is seeking someone to run large-scale community projects. These include amplifying our grants program to fund community projects, curating governance groups where we bring community stakeholders into our technology planning, engaging with external teams like Gitcoin and EthDenver to support large-scale developer events, and giving technical presentations at events. This position also includes day-to-day engagement with our Slack group, helping to triage GitHub issues, hacking on demos, writing blog posts and technical guides, and more.
