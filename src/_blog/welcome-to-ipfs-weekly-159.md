Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in the [**InterPlanetary File System**](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy!

## Indexing and Interoperability on IPFS and Filecoin

‚ÄòContent routing‚Äô is the set of rules and mechanisms that dictate how information and traffic flow between users and applications on a network. At Protocol Labs, the Data Systems team works on the data layer of the transfer protocols in the interplanetary stack that Protocol Labs helps maintain. At Filecoin Orbit, Will Scott from the Data Systems team walked through how content routing currently works in IPFS, and the improvements being made to ensure more efficient and complete data transfer.

## Around the ecosystem üåè

In case you weren‚Äôt able to tune in for Filecoin Orbit 2021 ‚Äî on Friday, Protocol Labs announced the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FMV)! The FVM is an EVM-compatible execution environment for the Filecoin network, bringing computation and data storage together in a way that will revolutionize the dapp ecosystem on top of Filecoin. [**Learn more about the FVM**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw9syGiG31c&list=PL_0VrY55uV1_HE_bE-frkYUPGybjYHbNz&index=2).  
  
While the first IPFS version of the Aave Protocol UI went live with the open sourcing, now [**http://app.aave.com**](http://app.aave.com "http://app.aave.com") will always point to a pinned version of the latest IPFS hash, to allow for a decentralized front end controlled by the community. [**Learn more**](https://twitter.com/AaveAave/status/1450208507249053700?s=20).  
  
It has been just over one year since the Filecoin mainnet went live. The past year, the community of developers, builders, entrepreneurs, investors, storage providers, and clients have been growing at breakneck speeds. Check out the complete overview of what‚Äôs been happening on Filecoin for the past year ‚Äî from research and engineering to use cases, collaborations, and more.
