Earlier this spring, IPFS & Filecoin teamed up with Chainlink to sponsor the [Chainlink Spring 2021 hackathon](https://chainlink-2021.devpost.com/), an event focused on building the next generation of smart contracts with Chainlink Oracles. Oracles are a way to connect smart contracts to the world outside the blockchain, so we were very eager to see what hackers would come up with. Read on to see the winners of the Protocol Labs prizes.

## Our challenges: Show us your best ‚ú®

We staked $5000 USD worth of prizes across five different categories: archiving, storage, NFTs, HTTP data, and a creative every day use, to see what would inspire the best builds.

Out of 144 total submissions, 38 chose to build with IPFS, Filecoin, or libp2p, so we had a tough road to narrow it down to the following five. 

### Prize #1 Winner: Edu4All - Decentralized Education Platform

üóÑ Best use of Chainlink for archiving or republishing data for provenance or archiving to combat dis/misinformation

@[youtube](r0bOi8fDAMU)

Created by Amr Zahran and Tosho Toshev, [Edu4ALL](https://rapid-dust-8956.on.fleek.co/) describes itself as a dapp with ‚Äúthe aim to connect students from all regions of the world with accredited certifications recognized globally in order to provide a quality education for all students.‚Äù With a React frontend, they were able to connect to the blockchain via Metamask to create this educational platform.

### Prize #2 Winner: CryptoLlama

‚õì Best tool for easing storing and retrieval of data with Filecoin for use in Chainlink or oraclizing Filecoin chain events

@[vimeo](535625281)

Created by Alice M. and Yuchen Zhao, [CryptoLlama](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/cryptollama) is a location-based NFT AR game built with both Chainlink VRF contracts and cute crypto llamas! By utilizing React and Viro AR package to build the AR app, Solidity smart contracts and Chainlink VRF they were able to create the dynamic cryptollama NFTs with random characteristics that were cute and creative.

### Prize #3 Winner: Korea Heritage and History NFT

üñº Best use of IPFS or Filecoin for NFTs - maybe it‚Äôs archiving, maybe it‚Äôs provenance connections, maybe it‚Äôs aggregation, maybe it‚Äôs tooling, maybe it‚Äôs up to you.

The [Korea Heritage and History NFT](http://3.236.231.250/) platform was built by the team of Seongwon Kwak, Melissa Ann Wilkinson, Valijon Khalilov, Bin Yoon, and Park Hyein, with the intention of recording Korea‚Äôs invaluable heritage over a period of 5,000 years and safely preserving it by converting it into NFT tokens.

### Prize #4 Winner: Stonent Project

üñ• Best IPFSizing of HTTP data - Chainlink is often used to pull data from the regular web, why not autopublish to IPFS while you‚Äôre there?

### Prize #5 Winner: Parametric Digital Asset Risk Management

üõ† Best Hack We‚Äôll Use Every Day that uses IPFS, Filecoin or libp2p

@[youtube](nHXhbZFmX6M)

Created by Lukas Sexton, Mike Robinson, Seth A., and Luis R., [Parametric Digital Asset Risk Management](https://devpost.com/software/parametric-digital-asset-risk-management) is a decentralized protocol offering protection to the risk-adverse to encourage DeFi lending and in the process, promote economic fairness. They created this protocol with Chainlink for data delivery for smart contracts, Scaffold-Eth for a development framework, and IPFS to deploy, host, and load their website.
