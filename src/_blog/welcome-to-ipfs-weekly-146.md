## Mint NFTs and Publish to IPFS From Wolfram

Jon Woodard, CEO of [Wolfram Blockchain Labs](https://blog.wolfram.com/2021/05/12/using-ipfs-filecoin-and-the-wolfram-language-to-build-a-unified-decentralized-services-interface/) (WBL), has worked to develop[ innovative smart contract solutions](https://www.wolframblockchainlabs.com/computational-facts/), including the opportunities for _collectible, credential,_ and _programmatic_ NFTs. During the five years Woodard and WBL have worked on NFTs, they have emerged as one of the largest sectors of consumer adoption for smart contracts. WBL has just announced the [Wolfram Language-Cardano](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) blockchain integration. The integration will make its debut with a liveminting event happening on July 27, 2021. During the liveminting event, an NFT will be created in real time on the Cardano blockchain for the audience, providing participants with a live look at innovation in progress.

## Introducing ChainSafe Storage (A Note from ChainSafe)

![](../assets/chainsafe-storage-sceenshot.png)

ChainSafe is proud to launch [**ChainSafe Storage**](https://storage.chainsafe.io/): Store files directly to the IPFS/Filecoin network. Storage is ChainSafe‚Äôs newest product which provides an intuitive front-end UI allowing devs to publicly pin and unpin files to IPFS, backed up to Filecoin. The service also exposes our APIs by providing API keys on demand, allowing anyone to build products connected to Filecoin and IPFS. We‚Äôre extremely excited to offer this product within the Filecoin and IPFS ecosystems. Our call to action for you: test it, build with it, explore with it. Discover the possibilities of building with Storage unlocks. To excite the imagination, here‚Äôs a reminder: our privacy-first, non-custodial file storage solution [**ChainSafe Files**](http://app.files.chainsafe.io/) was built using Storage. If you want to get in touch with our Files/Storage developers, don‚Äôt forget to drop into our Files #support channel on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/CprJHjrWG6) to ask questions.
