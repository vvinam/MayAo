Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in the [**InterPlanetary File System**](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy!

## Developing Consumer Decentralized Applications with Slate

![](../assets/slate-textile.jpg)

Slate is an open-source version of file storage that allows users to upload their files to the Filecoin network, download other users' files, and ensure accessibility from anywhere on the web. It runs on Textile buckets to interact with IPFS so it can leverage content addressing and other features of that network. Thanks to Textile, Slate can offer 30GB of free storage to each user. But what can Slate be used for in consumer-based applications? [**Find out now!**](https://blog.ipfs.io/developing-consumer-decentralized-applications-with-textile-slate/)

## **Brand new on IPFS**

* One year ago, the Filecoin mainnet launched! From October 18 - 22, the Filecoin, IPFS, and Protocol Labs ecosystems are coming together to celebrate at Filecoin Orbit. [**Check out all of the events happening this week and register**](https://orbit.filecion.io/) to join in for talks, demos, workshops, and more.
* Molly Mackinlay of Protocol Labs was featured in Protocol.com‚Äôs [**Source Code Podcast**](https://www.protocol.com/tag/source-code-podcast) last week speaking about web3, web apps, content moderation, & building an internet that lasts. [**Read excerpts from the interview and hear the full podcast**](https://www.protocol.com/ipfs-new-internet).
* Last week, Encode Club hosted an [**Expert panel on IPFS and Filecoin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm65mZAa984)for NFT Hack featuring David Choi, Mikeal Rogers, & Yusef Napora of Protocol Labs.
* Yusef Napora joined the Governance & DAOs Summit, part of ETHOnline '21 to present on "Simple Off Chain Data Storage Using Web3 Storage & NFT.Storage‚Äù, [**watch the full session.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDtMXrx7UmE)

## Around the ecosystem üåè

You can now [**connect decentralized Handshake domains to IPFS websites**](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/link-a-domain/#handshake)! Handshake shifts control of the root zone file away from ICANN to a decentralized blockchain. Handshake provides fully decentralized and uncensorable top-level domains that you can own and use for your websites. Namebase and Handshake offer users [**solutions to resolving web3 hostnames**](https://blog.ipfs.io/decentralizing-the-internet-s-root/).  
  
You often hear about the 10,000 NFT collection, but how does someone make thousands of unique images? Learn how to build an algorithmically generated image dataset in Python and host them on IPFS as a unique NFT with [**this tutorial**](https://dev.to/sydneylai/create-and-host-nfts-with-25-lines-of-code-4l4e) on dev.to written by Sydney Lai.  
  
Ipfs-coord has been released. This is a JavaScript npm library built on top of js-ipfs that provides high-level features such as subnets, peer discovery, E2EE, censorship resistance, and payments. It will help IPFS peers discover one another, coordinate around a common interest, and then stay connected around that interest. [**Find out more**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-coord) and collaborate.  
  
Couldn‚Äôt make it to Prague for the Nonfungible Castle event sponsored by NFT.Storage? You can watch a recording of William R. Lobkowic‚Äôs [**tour of the NFC exhibition**](https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1MYxNnrdkabxw) on display at the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague Castle.  
  
[**Crust Network**](https://crust.network/), a decentralized IPFS-compatible storage network, has[**announced its deployment to Moonriver**](https://medium.com/crustnetwork/crust-network-integrates-with-moonriver-to-bring-web3-ipfs-storage-to-the-kusama-ecosystem-b73d934293bf), an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on Kusama. Crust underpins web3 data and file architecture, and brings IPFS-based decentralized storage solutions to the Moonriver and Kusama ecosystems.
