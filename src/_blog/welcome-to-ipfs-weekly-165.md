## **Valist Relies on IPFS and Filecoin to Move Software from Web2 to Web3**

@[youtube](7ak6PQPDBkk)

App stores and websites are an outdated and insecure way to distribute software. The maxim ‚Äúwhere there‚Äôs a server, there‚Äôs a hack‚Äù has proven to be true despite the best efforts of corporations like Microsoft, Apple, and Google. The Web3 stack is able to change that and more. Valist is using IPFS and Filecoin to create a safer, faster, and more efficient way to distribute software through decentralized and persistent storage. To find out more, [watch the most recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ak6PQPDBkk&t=1s) in the Building Web3 video series featuring Valist and check out[this blog post](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-12-07-building-web3-valist/).

## **Brand New on IPFS**

1. IPFS Content IDs can play a [**key role**](https://medium.com/p/super-skills-a-mobile-application-use-case-for-dids-and-vcs-d174467ccf46)in developing better credentials and identification systems for gamified learning.
2. See [**how**](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_external_ipfs) you can use IPFS to store the content you upload to Nextcloud‚Äôs open source collaborative platform.
3. HolyJS brought together 600 JavaScript developers around the world for a week of learning and hacking. [**Check out this presentation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3tF5eec_t8) about using IPFS with Node.js.
4. Charles Freeborn presented at [**Dev Fest Lagos 2021**](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-lagos-presents-devfest-lagos-2021/) on December 3rd, teaching West African devs who wanted to learn more about how to leverage IPFS.

The deadline for the Chainlink x Filecoin Dev Grant has been extended to December 17th. Have an idea about how to extend the web3 stack into decentralized off-chain computation and storage? [**Share your proposal.**](https://t.co/YwEEagzCvq)   
  
[**Here‚Äôs a friendly reminder**](https://twitter.com/WAX_io/status/1466874884651376649) from WAX Blockchain, that if your NFT is not on IPFS, it‚Äôs not your NFT. [**Read up**](https://wax-io.medium.com/not-ipfs-not-your-nft-29bcf692702f) on exactly what that means and how to truly own what‚Äôs yours.
