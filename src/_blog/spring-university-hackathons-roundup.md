Last month, the IPFS project partnered with two different universities to sponsor student-led and organized hackathons focused on introducing ground-breaking initiatives at both the global and local level.

[Cal Hacks](https://helloworld.calhacks.io/), a nonprofit organization composed of University of California, Berkeley students, held a global hackathon to unite the innovators, creators, and troublemakers of the world, called [hello:world](https://helloworld.calhacks.io/). The goal was to inspire students to build something out of this world in the following categories: sustainability, connectivity, education, or community and civic engagement.

Similarly, the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) also held [CivHacks](https://www.civhacks.com/), an annual hackathon focused on providing a welcoming, engaging and creative environment to support social good in tech culture, open to several categories including health, sustainability, student success, and civics.

## Workshop: Introduction to IPFS

During these events, the IPFS project was happy to participate by introducing students to IPFS and the Web3 ecosystem.

Dietrich Ayala, developer onboarding and ecosystem development lead, led a quick introduction to IPFS, the content distribution protocol used for NFTs and Web3 dapps, which uses peer-to-peer networking and content-addressing (instead of location!) to securely and resiliently transfer data and files on the internet.
