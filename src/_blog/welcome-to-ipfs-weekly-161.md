[**Funding the Commons**](https://fundingthecommons.io/) is a virtual summit on November 12, 2021 for individuals and organizations building new models of sustainable public goods funding and value alignment in open source networks. Join Juan Benet of Protocol Labs, Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum, Karl Floersch of Optimism, and other thought leaders to discuss novel experiments and future directions for funding our collective commons. Full agenda coming soon.

## **The Three Fundamental Principles of IPFS**

Take a step back and reconnect with the fundamentals of IPFS ‚Äî what powers the Interplanetary File System, and what it means for the future of decentralized storage and content addressing.

1. Unique identification via content addressing.
2. Content linking via Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
3. Content discovery via distributed hash tables (DHTs).

## **Brand new on IPFS**

* As of last week, there are over 7 million NFTs stored via NFT.Storage and about 1 NFT being uploaded every second - and that‚Äôs just the beginning! Check out [**this twitter thread**](https://twitter.com/pooja_eth/status/1455969108428791809?s=21) for more.

* The Internet Archive was one of the first organizations to recognize the potential of IPFS to achieve the mission of storing humanity‚Äôs most valuable information. [**Listen to Internet Archive founder, Brewster Kahle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne_NyqYkQgo), on why he started the Archive.
* Just launched! [**Bittensor**](http://www.bittensor.com/) is building the largest decentralized text dataset on IPFS (codenamed: "the mountain") to enable decentralized artificial intelligence - [**learn more**](https://opentensor.gitbook.io/bittensor/understanding-bittensor/bittensor-dataset)!
