## Calling IPFS Builders

_Jupiter_ is a virtual hackathon lasting from late August to October focused on solutions building on IPFS or decentralized storage services that use IPFS. Technical support for Jupiter Hackathon is being provided by [Alibaba Cloud](https://us.alibabacloud.com/en), the digital technology and intelligence backbone of Alibaba Group. The hackathon kicks off today, August 25th, and will run through October.

There will be a couple of informative workshops and an AMA held as part of the hackathon, on September 7th and 22nd. [Applications will be accepted](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/531928/introduction) until September 30th. Judging of the projects will take place on October 14th and will be based on equally-weighted categories: Design, Novelty/Originality, Technical Complexity, Daily/Mass Usability, and Creativity/Fun.

On October 23rd, the Jupiter Hackathon will culminate in an offline demo day and reward ceremony in Shanghai, where $19,000 in prizes will be split among five winners for the best projects!
