## ION is paving the way for a future with decentralized identities

![](../assets/ion-decentralized-identity.jpg)

How many people really know how their online identities work? In reality, online identity contains two types of data: identity data and identifiers. The way these two types of data have interacted over the course of the internet has defined our digital identities and how much control we have over them. ION is a solution being built as a framework for global, online, decentralized identities ‚Äî leveraging fundamentals like DID and IFPS‚Äô CID. Find out what the future of decentralized identities look like in [**this post**](https://blog.ipfs.io/ion-a-path-to-decentralized-identity/).

## Want to help build the new internet?

[**ARG Software Engineer**](https://arg.protocol.ai/job-software-engineer): The Protocol Labs [**Application Research Group (ARG)**](https://arg.protocol.ai/)is seeking a proactive and autonomous builder that can draft a roadmap forward and execute with code. You will need to have both a passion for hands-on development of distributed systems as well as problem solving within a complex system. **Protocol Labs**, Remote.

[**Developer Relations**](https://boards.greenhouse.io/textileio/jobs/4075619004): Textile is seeking someone to run large-scale community projects. These include amplifying our grants program to fund community projects, curating governance groups where we bring community stakeholders into our technology planning, engaging with external teams like Gitcoin and EthDenver to support large-scale developer events, and giving technical presentations at events. This position also includes day-to-day engagement with our Slack group, helping to triage GitHub issues, hacking on demos, writing blog posts and technical guides, and more.

With IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin, and other related projects, we are laying the foundation for a more resilient, more secure, distributed version of the web. This requires rigorous engineering from protocol design through all the phases of implementation. We strike a balance between pragmatism (put it on a ship :ferry:), deeply informed protocol design, and strict application of strong engineering principles. All of this happens in an environment defined by curiosity, passion, and a love for open source. **Protocol Labs**, Remote.
