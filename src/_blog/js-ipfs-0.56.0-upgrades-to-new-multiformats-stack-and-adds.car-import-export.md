# üî¶ Highlights

> upgrades to new multiformats stack and adds `.car` import/export

`js-IPFS@0.56.0` is on its way to the moon with a new data layer and import/export for [Content Addressable aRchive](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/)s along with many small bug fixes and performance improvements!

## üìö Multiformats

Underneath the Interplanetary Filesystem is a multitude of [Merkle Directed Acyclic Graphs](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/).  When you add a file to your IPFS node, you are converting it into a DAG representation of that file.  This DAG may be made up of one or more nodes of the [dag-pb](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/master/block-layer/codecs/dag-pb.md) or [raw](https://github.com/ipld/specs/issues/223) format in various [UnixFS layouts](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/blob/master/UNIXFS.md#layout).

DAG node formats are not limited to `dag-pb` or `raw`, however, we also have [dag-cbor](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/master/block-layer/codecs/dag-cbor.md), [dag-json](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/master/block-layer/codecs/dag-json.md) and the newcomer [dag-jose](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/master/block-layer/codecs/dag-jose.md).

The interfaces that these formats implement was previously defined by the [ipld/interface-ipld-format](https://github.com/ipld/interface-ipld-format) module, but there is an all-new implementation in the form of [BlockCodec](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats/blob/076290c2103eadc031f1a8069c5a296522eb9678/src/codecs/interface.ts#L21)s from the [multiformats/js-multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats) module.

`js-IPFS@0.56.0` ships with this new implementation which is much more lightweight and easier to work with and has seen the gzipped size of the [ipfs-http-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-http-client) bundle drop by amost 26%.

The most common formats are supported out of the box - [dag-pb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ipld/dag-pb), [dag-cbor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ipld/dag-cbor), [raw](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats/blob/076290c2103eadc031f1a8069c5a296522eb9678/src/codecs/raw.js), and [json](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats/blob/076290c2103eadc031f1a8069c5a296522eb9678/src/codecs/json.js).  Older formats that haven't been refactored into `BlockCodec`s yet such as [ipld-ethereum](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipld-ethereum) and [ipld-git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipld-git) can be converted at runtime using the [ipld-format-to-blockcodec](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipld-format-to-blockcodec) module, and you can configure your node to use them - see the [traverse-ipld-graphs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/examples/traverse-ipld-graphs) example for how to do this.

Multiformats also covers multihashing and multibase encoding of data.  Out of the box `js-IPFS@0.56.0` supports common hashes and bases such as `sha2-256`, `base58btc` and `base32` but more esoteric hashes/bases will need to be configured in a similar way - see [the docs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/IPLD.md) for more information and howtos.

If you want to learn more about Merkle DAGs, there's a whole [tutorial](https://proto.school/merkle-dags) on the ProtoSchool website!

## `.car` import/export

The low-level `ipfs.block.put` and `ipfs.block.get` commands allow you to get and put invidiual blocks into your blockstore, but this can be tedious when dealing with large [DAG](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/)s since you will invoke these operations multiple times and without interpreting the blocks as you read them, there's no way to follow [links](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/) to other blocks.

Enter the [Content Addressable aRchive](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/) or `.car` file.  This file functions as storage for the blocks that make up one or more DAGs, consisting of a root [CID](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/) then some or all of the blocks that are children of that `CID`.

`.car` files can be exported from `js-IPFS@0.56.0` and later with:

```console
$ jsipfs dag export ${CID} | archive.car
```

and imported with:

```console
$ jsipfs dag import ./archive.car
```

or

```console
$ cat ./archive.car | jsipfs dag import
```

Equivalent API methods exist to perform the same operations against an in-process node or over HTTP to a remote js-IPFS or go-IPFS node - see the docs for [ipfs.dag.export](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/DAG.md#ipfsdagexportcid-options) and [ipfs.dag.import](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/core-api/DAG.md#ipfsdagimportsource-options) for more information.

Would you like to contribute to the IPFS project and don‚Äôt know how? Well, there are a few places you can get started:

- Check the issues with the `help wanted` label in the [js-IPFS repo](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
- Join an IPFS All Hands, introduce yourself and let us know where you would like to contribute: https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/#weekly-ipfs-all-hands
- Hack with IPFS and show us what you made! The All Hands call is also the perfect venue for demos, join in and show us what you built
- Join the discussion at https://discuss.ipfs.io/ and help users finding their answers.
- Join the [üöÄ IPFS Core Implementations Weekly Sync üõ∞](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/issues/992) and be part of the action!

# ‚ÅâÔ∏è Do you have questions?

The best place to ask your questions about IPFS, how it works, and what you can do with it is at [discuss.ipfs.io](https://discuss.ipfs.io). We are also available at the `#ipfs` channel on Freenode.
