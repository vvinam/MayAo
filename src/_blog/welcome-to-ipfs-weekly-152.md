## Pinata Introduces ‚ÄúSubmarining‚Äù

![](../assets/pinatasubmarining.jpeg)

Last week ‚Äã‚Äã[Pinata](http://pinata.cloud/) launched a new feature called [‚ÄúSubmarining‚Äù](https://medium.com/pinata/how-to-manage-nft-visibility-18e9b7a76b8c), a tool that enables users to make an IPFS file they upload private from the public IPFS network. This capability allows people to attach data to an NFT and control who can view it based on ownership of the NFT.

This concept has not yet existed in the NFT space but has been in high demand. The team at Pinata believes that Submarining is the next step in giving users more control over their content with the ability to choose how you want to share content, and with whomever they please.
